# Examining the Influence of Screen Time on Sleep Patterns Among College Students: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction
Electronic devices play a crucial role in our daily lives, with screens being a significant part of this interaction. This includes devices such as cell phones, computers, tablets, and televisions, all of which impact various aspects of our wellbeing. Sleep, a fundamental physiological process, is vital for physical, mental, emotional, and social health. This study aims to investigate the relationship between screen time and sleep patterns, focusing on sleep length, quality, and the overall sleep-wake cycle by reviewing existing literature and conducting hypothesis testing.

## Abstract
This research explores the correlation between sleep patterns and screen time among college students aged 19 to 25. Data was collected via Google Forms from Android smartphone users, focusing on their screen time and sleep duration over a week. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality. Students with sleep disorders and those on sleep medication were excluded from the study.

## Objectives
To determine if there is a relationship between sleep quality and screen time.


## Questionnaire Creation
The questionnaire was created using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for a duration of one week. It also included questions about total screen time in hours per week.
